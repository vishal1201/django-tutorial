My Following of the 'Writing your first Django app' Tutorial. Fun way to learn Django.
Here's a link to the actual tutorial - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/
It is split in 7 sub-tutorials and this repository is a step-by-step reflection of my learnings of the same.
Feel free to use it/contribute. One may choose to use this as a reference while going through the tutorial as it has been created under the same guidance.
